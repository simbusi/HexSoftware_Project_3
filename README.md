Health Care App for Hemophilia

HemoCare allows smooth communication between patients and healthcare providers, tracks health metrics, and offers timely medical advice.
This design ensures a holistic approach to managing hemophilia, emphasizing communication, real-time tracking, and personalized advice, 
while ensuring the security and privacy of sensitive health information.

Key Features:
1. User Profiles
Patient Profile

Pain scale: Option to log and track pain levels.
3. Health Data Sharing

Doctor notifications: Doctors receive alerts when a patient logs a critical event (e.g., a major bleeding incident).
Secure messaging:
Patients and doctors can communicate securely within the app.
Allows doctors to give advice or adjust treatment plans based on real-time data.
4. Analytics and Reporting
Monthly health reports: Summarizes key health metrics (e.g., number of bleeding events, medication adherence) for patient review and doctor consultations.
Symptom trends: Track patterns such as increased bleeding frequency or medication efficacy.
Visual graphs: Easy-to-read charts showing trends in health metrics like bleeds, pain, and medication usage.
5. Emergency Features
